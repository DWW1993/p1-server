## Design

The design is up to you, but use popular sites and design styles to guide your own styling - Have chosen basic color scheme and done rudimentary styling. Some pages have a setup.

## Additonal

Feel free to add features, components, routes, as you see fit. As long as the base requirements are met you can do whatever you want - Are planning to add extra functionality to user account page. Plan to see all of a user's chirps as well as their followers and who they follow. Etc. Have done some styling to this end, but no actual functionality is coded.

## Deployment

Your projects do not need to be deployed to heroku. Once we are finished with this project we will try to depoy them, and it may work it may not. Who knows - Have not reached point where it is ready to deploy.
